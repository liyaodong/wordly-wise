== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this plugin works?

Just install the plugin, and your page will have a magic "Translate to" bar on top of your article. You can buy License keys from my website, and it's cheap since it only costs you when a user actually tries to translate.

= Will it slow down my website?

The translation will occur seamlessly as the content enters the user's view, and with caching implemented, it will be lightning-fast without any impact on website speed.
